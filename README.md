## Abstract

Cubebox is a music sequencer designed to visualize tones as colors, and blend those colors together in RGB space in the way that they are heard in auditory space.

### Color Scheme

The color scheme is derived from [Alexander Scriabin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Scriabin)'s  [Clavier à lumières](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavier_%C3%A0_lumi%C3%A8res), a color organ that sought to imitate or enhance the Scriabin's own synaesthetic associations of pitch and color.
